*Research*

In one of my internships in Taichung Veterans General Hospital, I conducted a Genome - Wide Association Study using Taiwan Biobank and R,SAS and PLINK as tools for data analysis. My research _"A Genome-wide Association Study of hyperuricemia and hypertension using 15998 variants in Taiwan Biobank‚Äù_ was later accepted as poster in *2019 Multiomics and Precision Medicine Joint Conference Poster, NCKU Dec 7th-8th 2019*.

Following the internship, I did research in metabolomics using weight loss data hoping to find out which metabolic pathways influenced weight loss.This research was funded by the Ministry of Science.

*Internships*
---

While doing research, I gradually grew more interest in the computer and programming side, so I did my internship in Cathay Bank as a IT intern. In my internship, I modified COBOL code and learned the angular framwork.

Following the internship, I joined Pizza Hut as a data analyst intern using Python for customer segmentation, and campaign efficiency analysis.
